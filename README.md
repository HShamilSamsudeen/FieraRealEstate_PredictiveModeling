# Fiera Real Estate - Predictive Modeling for Canadian Industrial Real Estate

A capstone data project for Fiera Real Estate (FRE).

Multiple Linear Regression analysis was leveraged using CBRE & statscan data to predict industrial real-estate hotspots in Canada. 

Feature selection was done using backwards elimination and feature scaling such as standardization was used. 

The outcome of this project was to reduce the time Asset Managers spent performing due-diligence prior to industrial space investment in provinces/towns. Using this model Fiera Real Estate Asset Managers could narrow down their list of regions and this time & cost-savings leads to higher investment efficiency. The model is also a repeatable process which current analysts at FRE could update using the latest statscan/CBRE data in order to avoid prediction errors arising from extrapolation.
